Uber Hackathon 2022 Mungozer Project

Team: Mungo208

INSTRUCTIONS:

This project requires Python3 installed on your system

1. Download the code as a zip file.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Open the terminal and set the parent directory to the extracted folder (cd to the folder).
4. Enter "pip install -r requirements.txt" (Without quotes) or install the packages "pymongo", "dnspython", and "progress" manually.
5. For Windows:
    Option 1) You can run main.py to use the program on your web browser with the command "py main.py" (Without quotes). 
              This option requires a web browser like Google Chrome, Opera, or Firefox with their latest versions, non-admin read and write file permissions and localhost:8000 port should be available to use and reach. 
              Note: If you receive any errors while running the code, starting php.exe or using the website, your system may not be compatible with the scripts in main.py. Try Option 2 instead.
    Option 2) If you receive any errors or you can't satisfy the requirements at line 15, you can run our code using the command line interface (CLI). Just run main_cli.py with the command "py main_cli.py" (Without quotes). 

   For Mac OS:
    You can run our code using the command line interface (CLI). Just run main_cli.py with the command "py main_cli.py" (Without quotes). 

   For other operating systems:
    We DO NOT guarantee that Option 1 in the Windows part will work, but Option 2 should work.
